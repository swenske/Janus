// Package espswitch mounts the ESP and makes a given A/B slot's
// already-staged Unified Kernel Image the one \EFI\BOOT\<BootFilename>
// actually boots - a plain file copy, no PE manipulation, no build
// tooling, ever, on the node: the target OS has no package manager and
// can never shell out to ukify/sbsign itself, which is exactly why
// image/disk/activate-slot.sh stages *both* slots' UKIs on the ESP
// (\JANUS\UKI-A.EFI / UKI-B.EFI) at build/install time in the first
// place.
//
// Shared by two independent processes that both need this same
// mechanism, triggered two different ways: internal/api/lifecycle.go's
// LifecycleService.Rollback (an explicit, gRPC-driven slot switch) and
// rootfs/init's own automatic revert when a wait_for_health Upgrade
// never confirms healthy (see internal/bootcommit) - factored out once
// there were two real consumers, not duplicated a second time across
// that package boundary, the same reasoning internal/bootslot was
// factored out for.
