# Proves the management dashboard's backend (dashboard/backend) works
# end to end against a real, running node - not a mock gRPC server, not
# just that the Go code compiles. Reuses the same real-boot + debugfs
# PKI extraction pattern every other lifecycle test in this project uses
# (see hack/qemu-lifecycle-rollback-test.sh) to get a real admin
# credential for a real booted node, then drives dashboardd's own REST
# API exactly the way the (still-to-come) frontend will:
#
#   1. boot disk.img for real, extract ca.crt/admin.crt/admin.key from
#      its STATE partition via debugfs.
#   2. start dashboardd against a scratch data directory.
#   3. POST /api/nodes with the node's real address + the extracted
#      admin credential as the one-time "bootstrap" credential - proves
#      the add-node flow genuinely calls GenerateClientConfiguration
#      against the real node and gets back a working, freshly-issued
#      service credential (not the bootstrap one relayed - see
#      dashboard/backend/internal/nodeproxy's own package doc for why
#      that's not just a design choice but a cryptographic
#      impossibility).
#   3b. tranche 6: add-node via a .pfx upload instead of pasted PEM
#      text (dashboard/backend/main.go's parseAddNodeRequest, the
#      frontend's default mode as of dashboard/frontend/src/App.jsx's
#      AddNodeForm) - a real openssl-built .pfx bundling the admin
#      cert+key plus the node's ca.crt (via -certfile, exactly how a
#      real user's would be built), added and immediately removed
#      again so it doesn't interfere with the main JSON-based flow
#      below. Also checks the two real error paths: a wrong password,
#      and a .pfx missing the bundled CA certificate - both need a
#      real, actionable message, not a generic parse failure.
#   4. GET /api/nodes lists it (name/address/port only, no credential).
#   5. hit the allocated per-node HTTPS port with the *bootstrap*
#      admin cert as the TLS client certificate (any cert issued by the
#      node's own CA satisfies the gate, not specifically the stored
#      service one - the gate and the relay credential are deliberately
#      different keys) and check the JSON response contains real values
#      relayed from the actual node (same values hack/
#      qemu-system-info-test.sh already proves are real).
#   6. confirm the mTLS gate actually rejects both no client cert at all
#      and a cert from an unrelated CA - a real security boundary, not
#      just "it happens to work with the right cert".
#   7. exercise the tranche 4 ops/config relay (dashboard/backend/
#      internal/nodeproxy/ops.go) against the node's own bootstrap
#      config - deliberately scoped to what's testable without a custom
#      boot fixture: ShowInfo and GetConfig against real values;
#      ApplyConfig with the exact same config read back (must be
#      accepted - proves the round trip) and with deliberately garbage
#      config (must be rejected, with a real validation error, and must
#      NOT disturb the running config - internal/haproxy.Manager.Apply's
#      own "never overwritten on a rejected apply" guarantee, now
#      proven through the dashboard's own relay too); BackendList
#      against its own real not-yet-implemented state (internal/api/
#      haproxy.go's own doc comment - falls through to
#      UnimplementedHAProxyServiceServer, so the relay must surface a
#      real error here, not fake a success); MapList/CertificateList
#      against the bootstrap config's genuinely empty map/cert list (a
#      correctly-relayed empty response, not a gap - protojson's
#      omitempty drops an empty repeated field entirely, confirmed
#      against a real boot before encoding this assertion); a real
#      CertificateUpload/List/Delete round trip (HAProxy's cert *store*
#      accepts uploads unconditionally, unlike file-backed maps/ACLs,
#      which only exist if the config already declares one - exercising
#      a real MapUpdate/ACLUpdate success case would need injecting a
#      whole custom haproxy.cfg + map/ACL files onto STATE before boot,
#      real effort for coverage `internal/haproxy`'s own CI step already
#      provides at the non-dashboard layer - so this test settles for
#      proving MapUpdate genuinely reaches the real node and surfaces
#      its real "no such map" error correctly, not a staged success).
#      Writing this step's assertions found two real, previously-
#      undiscovered bugs, both fixed alongside this test: (a) a missing
#      SELinux policy rule (selinux/policy.conf) denied the haproxy_t
#      domain write access to the fifo_file pipe internal/haproxy.
#      Manager.Validate's `haproxy -c` inherits from its janusd_t
#      parent (a genuinely different object from the supervised
#      process's own console-backed stdout/stderr, already covered) -
#      every validation error was being silently denied mid-write,
#      captured as an empty error list instead of haproxy's real
#      parse-error text, on a real boot only (a permissive/plain local
#      run never saw it - see manager.go's own comment); (b) internal/
#      haproxy.Manager.statsCommand had no read deadline at all - a
#      malformed multi-line payload (found via a test-harness bug of
#      this test's own early draft, not production code, but the gap
#      it exposed is real) leaves HAProxy's stats socket waiting for
#      more input forever, blocking the reading goroutine past any
#      caller's own timeout (fixed with a bounded conn.SetDeadline).
#   8. DELETE the node, confirm it's gone from the list AND its port
#      stops accepting connections entirely.
#   9. re-add it, restart dashboardd against the *same* data directory,
#      and confirm both the registry and the per-node listener come back
#      without needing to re-add anything - the whole point of
#      persisting to disk rather than keeping the registry in memory
#      only.
#   10. tranche 7: the main port's own admin auth (dashboard/backend/
#      internal/auth) - confirmed via a real cookie jar throughout this
#      whole script (every /api/nodes* call needs it, matching what the
#      real UI now enforces): /api/nodes with no session at all must be
#      refused (401), a first-run setup call establishes the one admin
#      password and logs the caller in via the returned session cookie,
#      and - after the dashboardd restart in step 9, since sessions are
#      deliberately in-memory-only and don't survive a restart - a fresh
#      login call is needed before the registry is reachable again.
#   11. Point 2 suite, tranche 2: node self-registration (dashboard/
#      backend/internal/pending + register.go's startRegistrationListener)
#      - a synthetic node CA + service credential (standing in for what
#      a real janusd would generate locally and send - tranche 2 is
#      the Controller side only, janusd doesn't self-register yet)
#      POSTed to the dedicated TLS registration port (separate from
#      both :8080 and the per-node pool - see startRegistrationListener's
#      own doc comment for why). Checks: a real registration is
#      accepted and shows up in GET /api/pending (auth-gated, like
#      everything else under /api/); missing required fields refused
#      with 400; a cert/key pair that doesn't actually parse together
#      refused with 400 and a real error, not a generic failure; the
#      pending entry survives a dashboardd restart (same reasoning as
#      the node registry itself - a node only announces once per boot,
#      so losing this to an in-memory store would strand it).
#   12. Point 2 suite, tranche 3: approve/reject the pending queue
#      (register.go's handlePendingAction/approvePending/rejectPending,
#      wired into the frontend's PendingList component). Two more
#      synthetic self-registrations (separate from the one used for the
#      restart-persistence check, which is left untouched): approving
#      one must move it into GET /api/nodes with a real allocated port
#      and a genuinely running mTLS-gated listener (any cert from its
#      own CA completes a real TLS handshake against it), and remove it
#      from /api/pending; rejecting the other must remove it from
#      /api/pending and it must never appear in /api/nodes at all.
#      Also checks that rejecting an already-rejected id is a real 404,
#      not a silent success. Writing this coverage surfaced a real bug
#      in approvePending itself, fixed alongside it: on a listener-start
#      failure (e.g. a port conflict) it left the pending entry in place
#      "to be retried" but had already called store.Add - a retry then
#      called store.Add a second time with a fresh id, permanently
#      orphaning the first, listener-less entry instead of actually
#      retrying it. Fixed by rolling the store entry back
#      (store.Remove) whenever startListener fails, verified by hand
#      against a live dashboardd instance (occupying the allocated port
#      to force the failure, confirming no orphan after the failed
#      attempt, then freeing the port and confirming a clean retry)
#      before encoding it here.
#   13. Point 2 suite, tranche 6: GET /api/controller-info (auth-gated
#      like everything else under /api/) - what an operator needs to
#      fill in janusctl lifecycle install's own -controller-address/
#      -controller-ca flags for a new node. Checks the gate itself and
#      that the returned CA certificate is a real, parseable
#      certificate (the dashboard's own TLS identity) - not the
#      suggested address's exact value, which depends on this test
#      host's own network interfaces (see suggestRegisterAddress's own
#      doc comment).
#   14. user-requested: the main port is HTTPS-only now (every
#      /api/nodes*/pending*/controller-info call in this script uses
#      https:// -k) - checks the session cookie set at setup is
#      genuinely marked Secure (curl's own cookie-jar file format,
#      not just that https:// happens to be the URL scheme used
#      throughout this script).
