# Proves Phase 4's runtime kernel hardening (rootfs/init/main.go's
# hardenSysctls) actually applies every sysctl it claims to, on a real
# boot - not just that the Go code doesn't panic, and not just that the
# matching kernel/configs/janus_defconfig options compile in (a
# real gap this test's own first draft caught: CONFIG_SYN_COOKIES
# wasn't set, so /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_syncookies didn't exist at all
# and that one write silently logged "no such file or directory" while
# every other sysctl succeeded - the boot itself, and even the network
# test, looked completely fine either way, since a non-fatal write
# failure doesn't block anything). Same boot pattern hack/
# qemu-network-test.sh uses (janusd -> haproxy inside the VM,
# real HTTP over virtio-net), plus a check of every "init: sysctl ..."
# console line hardenSysctls prints - each one is logged as it's
# written, success or failure, specifically so an external test like
# this one can verify the actual outcome without needing a shell inside
# the guest to read /proc/sys back.
