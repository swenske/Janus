# Proves LifecycleService.Install actually partitions a genuinely blank
# disk from scratch (internal/diskimage + github.com/diskfs/go-diskfs -
# sgdisk/mtools/mkfs.ext4 don't exist on the target OS, see internal/
# api/install.go's own doc comment) and produces a real, independently
# bootable Janus image, and that its two safety refusals - an
# already-installed disk, and the disk this node itself is currently
# booted from - both actually reject in practice, not just in code
# review.
#
# Unlike every other lifecycle test in this project, the Install call
# itself doesn't need to run inside a VM: Install has no A/B/STATE
# machinery of its own to depend on (it's what *creates* that machinery
# on a blank target), so janusd runs natively on the test host here
# - the same pattern image-build.yml's own "HAProxy gRPC API integration
# test" step already uses, reading its bootstrapped PKI creds straight
# off -pki-dir rather than scraping a QEMU console log for them. Only
# the *result* - is the disk Install just wrote genuinely bootable? - is
# verified under a real VM, the same standard every other "is this
# actually bootable" claim in this project is held to.
#
#   1. build a release bundle (image/release/assemble.sh) from the
#      *existing* rootfs build output - genuinely-new-content isn't the
#      point here, hack/qemu-lifecycle-upgrade-test.sh already proves
#      that.
#   2. run janusd natively (root, for CAP_SYS_CHROOT - haproxy's
#      chroot() needs it, same reasoning as image-build.yml's own
#      integration test step), read its bootstrapped admin/CA creds
#      straight from -pki-dir.
#   3. call `janusctl lifecycle install` against a freshly
#      truncated, empty *file* standing in for a blank disk -
#      go-diskfs works identically against a real block device or a
#      plain file (confirmed empirically - a full GPT+ext4+FAT32 disk
#      built this way, with real bundle content, booted successfully
#      under OVMF - before this script was ever written), so a file is
#      exactly as valid a target as a real /dev/sdX for what's being
#      tested here.
#   4. call Install a *second* time against the same, now-installed
#      file - must be refused (refuseIfAlreadyInstalled).
#   5. boot the installed disk.img under real OVMF, single virtio-blk
#      drive, no -kernel/-append (same pattern hack/
#      qemu-uefi-ab-boot-test.sh uses) - must answer real HTTP 200 and
#      log a fresh PKI bootstrap, proving Install's output isn't just
#      "the right bytes in the right place" as far as a static
#      inspection could tell.
#   6. extract fresh PKI creds from the *booted* instance's own STATE
#      partition (via debugfs, same reasoning as every other lifecycle
#      test here - a script can't watch a live console the way a human
#      doing this for real would), then call `janusctl lifecycle
#      install` against /dev/vda -
#      the disk this now-running instance actually booted from - and
#      confirm it's refused (refuseIfCurrentBootDisk). This is the one
#      guard that structurally can't be tested in step 2-4's native
#      process, which has no real dm-mod.create= cmdline to compare
#      against at all.
#   7. bonus: call Rollback on the same booted instance and confirm it
#      comes back up healthy on slot B - since Install wrote *identical*
#      content and UKI to both slots, this proves that claim for real
#      rather than only ever having booted slot A.
#   8. Point 2 suite, tranche 4: Install called with
#      -controller-address/-controller-ca (a synthetic Controller CA,
#      since only its bytes matter here - janusd verifying against it
#      is tranche 5, not built yet) - checks that controller/address
#      and controller/ca.crt land on the blank disk's own STATE
#      filesystem with exactly the right content, extracted directly
#      (no boot needed, this tranche is Install's write side only), and
#      that -controller-address without -controller-ca is refused
#      client-side by janusctl before it ever reaches janusd (the
#      proto's own InstallRequest doc comment: no trust-on-first-use).
#
# Usage: hack/lifecycle-install-test.sh <rootfs-dir> <bzImage> <haproxy-bin> <janusd-bin> <janusctl-bin>

# Real bug caught by a real CI run, not assumed: this cleanup trap used
# to kill the native haproxy child with `sudo pkill -f "$HAPROXY_BIN"`
# (e.g. "build/haproxy") - but `pkill -f` matches the *entire* command
# line of every process, and this script's own argv (`./hack/
# lifecycle-install-test.sh ... build/haproxy ...`) contains that exact
# string as one of its own positional arguments. The trap ended up
# killing *this script's own process*, mid-trap, right after its very
# last echo - `make` reported it as "Terminated" (exit 2) despite every
# single check already having passed and printed. Fixed by killing the
# real haproxy process by its own pid (janusd's default
# `-haproxy-pid` path), never by a fuzzy command-line pattern match.
# cmd/janusd has no SIGTERM handler that propagates to its haproxy
# child, so killing janusd alone (below) leaves haproxy an orphan,
# reparented to init, still bound to :8080 - confirmed the hard way on
# janus-runner01 itself: a real CI run's *next* job started with
# :8080 already taken, tracked back to a leftover `build/haproxy`
# process whose start time lined up exactly with this test's own native
# phase. A first fix tried killing by pid from haproxy's own -p pid
# file (/run/janus/haproxy.pid) - wrong in a different way:
# internal/haproxy.Manager's seamless-reload path (-sf <old pid>, taken
# whenever that pid file already exists from an earlier run of this
# same test) leaves the *previous* instance to soft-stop-drain rather
# than exit outright, and repeated local runs showed the pid file can
# end up missing entirely while multiple old haproxy processes are
# still very much alive - confirmed by hand: `sudo cat` on the "current"
# pid file came back "No such file or directory" while `pgrep -x
# haproxy` still listed several. `pkill -x haproxy` (exact process-name
# match, not `-f`'s fuzzy full-command-line match - see this file's
# earlier comment on why `-f` is the wrong tool here) sidesteps needing
# the pid file at all, confirmed to actually kill a real lingering
# instance with a plain SIGTERM in well under a second.
