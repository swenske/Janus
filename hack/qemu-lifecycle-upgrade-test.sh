# Proves LifecycleService.Upgrade actually installs a *genuinely new*
# rootfs onto the inactive slot over a real gRPC call, not just that it
# can re-stage the same content Rollback already covers:
#
#   1. boot the existing disk.img (image/disk/assemble.sh, slot A
#      active, bootstrap config on :8080) under real OVMF - HTTP 200
#      confirms it's up, PKI bootstraps onto STATE.
#   2. build a second, genuinely different rootfs (same init/
#      janusd/haproxy binaries, a haproxy.cfg bound to :8081
#      instead of :8080 - different content, different squashfs, a
#      different root hash) and a release bundle for it (image/
#      release/assemble.sh - rootfs.squashfs/rootfs.verity/uki-a.efi/
#      uki-b.efi).
#   3. inject the v2 bundle's 4 files into disk.img's STATE partition
#      *before ever booting it* (under a new "upgrade/" directory,
#      via debugfs -w), then extract ca.crt/admin.crt/admin.key back
#      out the same way, after boot A (janusd does print all three
#      to the console on first boot, but a script can't watch a live
#      console the way a human doing this for real would). Both have
#      to happen through debugfs directly on the image file, never
#      through a live mount from the host: janusctl (host) and janusd
#      (guest) don't share a filesystem across the QEMU host/guest
#      boundary, unlike CLAUDE.md's normal "share a filesystem" case -
#      and writing to STATE from the host while the guest *also* has
#      it mounted read-write would just corrupt it (this is exactly why
#      the injection happens before the first boot, not concurrently
#      with a running one).
#   4. call `janusctl lifecycle upgrade` over real mTLS, pointing
#      at the bundle's path *as the guest itself sees it*
#      (/etc/.state/upgrade, since rootfs/init/main.go's mountState
#      mounts all of STATE there) - Upgrade must write the v2
#      squashfs/verity to slot B's partitions (slot A is active, so B
#      is the target), switch the ESP to slot B's (v2) UKI, and reboot
#      - all without touching STATE or slot A's own content at all.
#   5. after the guest reboots itself (no -no-reboot, same as the
#      rollback test), it must come back up healthy (HTTP 200 on
#      :8080 again - *not* :8081, see the note below) with PKI's
#      "first boot" line NOT reappearing (STATE survived), and the
#      kernel's own "Kernel command line:" log line must show it
#      booted from slot B's partitions (PARTLABEL=BOOT-B-DATA PARTLABEL=BOOT-B-HASH) with v2's
#      root hash, not slot A's.
#   6. as a bonus check that Upgrade didn't corrupt the *other* slot's
#      own staging: call Rollback afterward and confirm the guest comes
#      back up healthy again, with the kernel cmdline now showing slot
#      A's partitions (PARTLABEL=BOOT-A-DATA PARTLABEL=BOOT-A-HASH) and v1's root hash again -
#      proving slot A's pre-existing \JANUS\UKI-A.EFI is still
#      intact and correct.
#
# Real bug found empirically while writing this test (not a production
# bug - a wrong assumption in the test's *own* first draft, which
# expected v2's bootstrap config on :8081 to actually get served after
# the upgrade): rootfs/init/main.go's seedPersistentHaproxyCfg only
# seeds STATE's haproxy/haproxy.cfg from the booting rootfs's own
# bootstrap default *if STATE doesn't already have one* - and STATE is
# one partition shared by both A/B slots, not duplicated per slot. By
# the time slot B ever boots, slot A's first boot has already persisted
# its own (:8080) config onto that shared STATE, so slot B's bind-
# mounted /etc/haproxy still serves *that*, never its own squashfs's
# bootstrap default - confirmed by booting the post-upgrade disk.img
# directly and finding :8080 (not :8081) answering. This matches the
# system's actual, intended design (an upgrade must never reset a
# node's live-applied HAProxy config back to some bootstrap default),
# so what changed here is the test's verification method, not
# lifecycle.go or main.go: proof that *genuinely new content* is
# running has to come from the kernel cmdline's root hash and slot
# device paths (both verified below), not from which HTTP port
# answers, since the served config is deliberately state-persisted and
# identical across both slots once slot A has booted once.
#
# Usage: hack/qemu-lifecycle-upgrade-test.sh <disk.img> <bzImage> <build-dir> <janusctl-bin>
# <disk.img> is image/disk/assemble.sh's output for the *original* (v1,
# :8080) image, mutated in place by this test. <build-dir> is the
# Makefile's own $(BUILD_DIR) - must contain init/janusd/haproxy
# (rootfs/assemble.sh's own inputs, reused here to build a v2 rootfs)
# and rootfs/{rootfs.squashfs,rootfs.verity,rootfs.roothash,
# rootfs.verity.info} (rootfs/assemble.sh's output for v1).
