#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Proves Point 2 suite tranche 5 end to end: a node provisioned with a
# Controller (LifecycleService.Install's controller_address/
# controller_ca_cert, tranche 4) actually self-registers with a real,
# running Janus Controller (dashboardd) on its own first boot - not a
# mock HTTP server standing in for either side.
#
#   1. start dashboardd natively on the test host (-advertise-address
#      10.0.2.2 - QEMU usermode networking's own fixed host-gateway
#      address, the address a QEMU guest actually uses to reach a
#      service on its host; without this, dashboardd's TLS identity
#      certificate's SAN list - built from this process's own network
#      interfaces, see loadOrCreateDashboardIdentity - would never
#      include an address the guest could verify the handshake
#      against, and every self-registration attempt below would fail
#      TLS verification outright, a real gap found while building this
#      test, not assumed - see dashboard/backend/main.go's own comment
#      on -advertise-address and dashboard/README.md's matching note
#      for the identical real-world case, a Docker bridge-networked
#      deployment).
#   2. set up the dashboard's one-time admin auth (same cookie-jar
#      pattern hack/qemu-dashboard-test.sh uses) so /api/pending and
#      /api/nodes are reachable.
#   3. run janusd natively (root, for CAP_SYS_CHROOT - same pattern
#      hack/lifecycle-install-test.sh uses) purely to serve the Install
#      RPC against a blank disk file, passing -controller-address
#      10.0.2.2:<register-port> and -controller-ca <dashboardd's own
#      identity cert> - a genuinely different disk than the one this
#      native janusd itself would ever boot from.
#   3b. the Controller is stopped while the node boots: the node logs
#      its failed attempt and retries on its own (selfregister.RetryDelay)
#      - once the Controller is back, it registers without a reboot.
#   4. boot the installed disk for real under OVMF, virtio-net +
#      usermode NAT (the guest reaches 10.0.2.2 automatically - no
#      special hostfwd needed for this, guest-initiated connections to
#      the host "just work" under QEMU's slirp stack) - and poll the
#      *real* dashboardd's GET /api/pending until the node shows up on
#      its own, with no RPC call from this script driving it: proves
#      cmd/janusd's own selfRegisterIfConfigured actually ran at boot,
#      read the provisioned config back off STATE (rootfs/init's
#      mountState bind-mounting STATE's controller/ subdirectory),
#      minted a fresh service credential locally, and reached the real
#      Controller over TLS verified against the CA it was given at
#      provisioning time.
#   5. approve the pending entry through the real dashboard API, then
#      confirm the resulting per-node listener's mTLS gate trusts the
#      CA the node self-reported - a cert extracted from the booted
#      guest's own STATE partition completes the handshake, a cert from
#      an unrelated CA is refused at the handshake itself. Doesn't go
#      all the way to a relayed response with real data the way hack/
#      qemu-dashboard-test.sh's own relay check does - see this part's
#      own comment in the script for why (QEMU usermode networking's
#      asymmetry: the host has no route back to the guest's own
#      advertised address, only hack/qemu-dashboard-test.sh's real,
#      host-reachable node address works for that, and nodeproxy's
#      relay logic itself is unchanged by this tranche).
#   6. boot the *same* disk.img a second time (a fresh QEMU invocation,
#      not a live in-guest reboot - nothing here needs the RPC-driven
#      reboot machinery hack/qemu-lifecycle-rollback-test.sh exercises)
#      and confirm no second pending entry ever appears - proving
#      internal/selfregister's persisted "registered" marker (on
#      STATE, survives the reboot) actually stops the node from
#      re-announcing itself every boot.
#
# dashboardd's own main port (DASHBOARD_ADDR_PORT) is HTTPS-only (user-
# requested - see dashboard/backend/main.go's own doc comment), so
# every curl call against it here uses https:// -k, same as hack/
# qemu-dashboard-test.sh - a real image-build.yml run caught this
# script's own copy having been missed when that change first landed
# (curl got Go's stdlib's own friendly 400 "sent an HTTP request to an
# HTTPS server", surfaced here as "dashboard admin setup returned 400,
# want 204"), fixed by applying the exact same fix, not by inspection.
