# Proves LifecycleService.Upgrade's wait_for_health actually confirms a
# healthy new slot and leaves it running - and, symmetrically, actually
# reverts and reboots back to the previous slot automatically when the
# new one never becomes healthy - both without any RPC call driving the
# revert itself: nobody is watching by then, the original Upgrade call's
# connection died with the first reboot. See internal/bootcommit's
# package doc and internal/api/lifecycle.go's Upgrade doc comment for
# the full mechanism this exercises end to end.
#
#   1. boot the existing disk.img (slot A active) for real, confirm
#      HTTP 200, extract PKI creds from STATE via debugfs (same
#      reasoning as hack/qemu-lifecycle-upgrade-test.sh: a script can't
#      watch a live console the way a human doing this for real would).
#   2. build two release bundles and inject *both* into disk.img's
#      STATE partition before ever booting it (same debugfs-before-
#      first-boot reasoning as hack/qemu-lifecycle-upgrade-test.sh -
#      janusctl and janusd don't share a filesystem across this
#      QEMU host/guest boundary):
#        - "good": just image/release/assemble.sh run against the
#          *existing* v1 rootfs build output - genuinely new content
#          isn't the point of this test (hack/qemu-lifecycle-
#          upgrade-test.sh already proves Upgrade installs genuinely
#          new content; this one is about the health-check/revert
#          mechanics), so there's no need to build a second rootfs for
#          this half.
#        - "broken": a *fresh* rootfs built with the host's own
#          dynamically-linked /bin/false standing in for janusd
#          (rootfs/assemble.sh's own <janusd-bin> argument takes
#          anything executable). This rootfs ships no dynamic linker or
#          libc at all (every real binary in it - init, janusd,
#          haproxy - is statically linked, by design), so Supervisor
#          doesn't even get as far as exec succeeding: every restart
#          attempt fails at spawn() itself ("no such file or directory"
#          for the missing ELF interpreter) - a realistic simulation of
#          a badly-built or wrong-architecture control-plane binary
#          landing in a release bundle, and it exercises exactly the
#          spawn-failure path of Supervisor.runOnce, not just the
#          child-exits-immediately one.
#        - "haproxy-broken": a *third* fresh rootfs with the real,
#          working init and janusd, but /bin/false standing in for
#          *haproxy* itself this time (rootfs/assemble.sh's
#          <haproxy-bin> argument, not <janusd-bin>) - janusd
#          starts up perfectly fine (it's the real binary), calls
#          internal/haproxy.Manager.Reload(), which fails and is logged
#          but not fatal (matching cmd/janusd/main.go's existing
#          "continue without it" behavior for a missing/broken haproxy),
#          and HAProxy's stats socket simply never comes into existence
#          - so every ShowInfo() call inside
#          cmd/janusd's own confirmBootHealth goroutine fails
#          forever. This is what actually exercises the real,
#          HAProxy-level health check this test is named for - the
#          *other* "broken" bundle above only ever exercises rootfs/
#          init's own Supervisor-level backstop (janusd itself never
#          running at all), a different, complementary failure mode.
#   3. calls `janusctl lifecycle upgrade -wait-for-health
#      -health-timeout 5` with the "good" bundle - the guest reboots
#      into slot B for real, and after health-timeout-plus-a-margin, the
#      console must show "bootcommit: confirmed healthy" and the kernel
#      cmdline must still show slot B's partitions/root hash - no revert.
#   4. calls the same RPC again with the "broken" (daemon-broken)
#      bundle, targeting whichever slot is inactive at that point (A,
#      since step 3 left B active) - the guest reboots into slot A,
#      janusd (really /bin/false) crash-loops immediately, and -
#      entirely on its own, no RPC involved - Supervisor's GiveUpAfter
#      elapses and the node reverts and reboots a *second* time, this
#      time back to slot B (RevertTo was recorded as whatever was active
#      *when the broken Upgrade was called*, i.e. B - not hardcoded back
#      to the original slot A) - proving the revert target is dynamic,
#      not a fixed fallback. HTTP must come back up on its own
#      afterward.
#   5. calls the same RPC a third time with the "haproxy-broken" bundle,
#      targeting whichever slot is inactive at that point (A again,
#      since step 4 left B active) - the guest reboots into slot A for
#      real (proving *this* rootfs, unlike the daemon-broken one, boots
#      and runs janusd just fine), and - again with no RPC involved,
#      this time via cmd/janusd's own confirmBootHealth rather than
#      rootfs/init's GiveUpAfter - reverts and reboots a second time,
#      back to slot B once more.
