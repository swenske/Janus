# Proves Phase 4 cont'd's SELinux policy (selinux/classes.conf +
# selinux/policy.conf, loaded at boot by rootfs/init/main.go's
# loadSELinuxPolicy) is genuinely complete, not just quietly permissive -
# the exact allow-rule set was only ever arrived at empirically, boot by
# boot, reading real AVC denials out of dmesg and fixing exactly what
# each one named (see selinux/policy.conf's own header and
# docs/architecture.md for the class-of-bug list that turned up this
# way: missing self:fd use, missing filesystem:associate on every single
# fs_use-labeled type, missing process:{noatsecure,rlimitinh,siginh} on
# every domain transition, missing peer/packet class rules for
# unlabeled/default-context network traffic under policycap
# always_check_network - none of which is guessable from reading the
# rule set alone, all of which showed up as a real "avc: denied" line on
# a real boot).
#
# Runs two boots against the same squashfs+dm-verity image (see
# hack/qemu-verity-boot-test.sh, which this shares its boot pattern
# with):
#   1. the kernel's own default (kernel/configs/janus_defconfig's
#      SECURITY_SELINUX_DEVELOP=y keeps this permissive unless told
#      otherwise) - must show the policy actually loading
#      ("init: selinux: loaded policy"), must show real HTTP 200 (proves
#      loading the policy didn't break anything), and must show zero
#      "avc: denied" lines - a permissive-mode denial doesn't block
#      anything, so a clean boot with real traffic passing is NOT enough
#      on its own to prove the rule set is complete; only an empty grep
#      for denials is.
#   2. the identical image, `enforcing=1` added to the cmdline - the
#      real test of whether the rule set is actually sufficient, not
#      just quiet: SELinux now genuinely blocks anything not allowed.
#      Must show the same real HTTP 200 and the same zero denials - a
#      single missing allow rule here would make something actually
#      fail (a mount, an exec, a socket operation), not just log.
#
# SELinux stays permissive by *default* in the shipped kernel config
# even though this test proves enforcing already works cleanly -
# flipping the shipped default is a separate, deliberate decision this
# slice doesn't make on its own (see docs/architecture.md).
#
# Usage: hack/qemu-selinux-test.sh <bzImage> <rootfs-dir>
# <rootfs-dir> must contain rootfs.squashfs, rootfs.verity,
# rootfs.roothash and rootfs.verity.info (see rootfs/assemble.sh), built
# with the SELinux policy bundled in (see the Makefile's rootfs-build
# target - it always includes it, there's no separate opt-out build).
