# Generates Janus's real Secure Boot signing key + certificate -
# unlike gen-test-key.sh (throwaway, regenerated fresh every CI run),
# this is meant to be run ONCE, by a human, outside of CI: the result
# is a long-term root of trust every Janus node's firmware will be
# asked to enroll into its Secure Boot db. Losing the private key means
# losing the ability to sign future updates for already-enrolled nodes;
# leaking it means anyone can sign a UKI those nodes will boot.
#
# No HSM in this project's threat model (single maintainer, self-hosted
# CI) - the private key is meant to be uploaded as a GitHub Actions
# encrypted secret (see .github/workflows/image-build.yml's own
# "production-signed release bundle" step, gated on that secret
# existing) and then backed up somewhere safe *outside* this working
# directory (a password manager, an encrypted volume, ...) - this
# script deliberately does not do that upload itself, or delete
# anything, since both are exactly the kind of irreversible step that
# needs a human actually looking at what's happening.
#
# The certificate half is NOT secret - it has to be shipped and
# enrolled into every node's firmware db, so it's meant to be committed
# to the repo (image/secureboot/production-cert.pem) once generated.
# Only the private key needs to stay out of git entirely.
#
# 20 years validity, not gen-test-key.sh's 10: rotating this cert means
# re-enrolling it into every already-deployed node's firmware by hand
# (there's no remote db-rotation flow in this project yet), so it's
# deliberately long-lived rather than something to renew casually.
#
# Usage: image/secureboot/gen-production-key.sh <out-dir>
# Writes <out-dir>/{key.pem,cert.pem}. Refuses to overwrite an existing
# key.pem - this is meant to run exactly once ever, not casually rerun.
