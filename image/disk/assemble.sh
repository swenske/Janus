# Assembles a single, real GPT-partitioned disk image - the actual,
# complete shape a deployed node would have: an EFI System Partition
# (ESP) with the active slot's Unified Kernel Image at
# \EFI\BOOT\BOOTX64.EFI (image/uki/assemble.sh + image/uki/esp-image.sh
# - no boot manager, matching this project's "no unnecessary
# components" design, see hack/qemu-uefi-boot-test.sh), two
# independently bootable A/B slots (BOOT-A-DATA/BOOT-A-HASH and
# BOOT-B-DATA/BOOT-B-HASH, each a squashfs data + dm-verity hash tree
# pair, same content rootfs/assemble.sh already produces), and the
# persistent STATE partition (rootfs/state-image.sh).
#
# This project's earlier QEMU test harnesses
# (hack/qemu-verity-boot-test.sh, hack/qemu-state-persist-test.sh) each
# attach the same build artifacts as separate virtio-blk drives rather
# than partitions of one disk - those keep working unchanged and still
# cover what they always covered (dm-verity tamper detection, STATE
# persistence). This script, hack/qemu-ab-boot-test.sh and
# hack/qemu-uefi-boot-test.sh cover something they don't: that the
# real, single-disk, UEFI-bootable layout actually works.
#
# Both A/B slots get the SAME rootfs content at build time - there's no
# LifecycleService.Upgrade yet to install something different into the
# inactive slot (see docs/architecture.md's Phase 3 notes). "Active"
# here only controls which slot's device paths get baked into the ESP's
# UKI cmdline - see image/disk/activate-slot.sh for switching that on
# an already-assembled disk, in place, without touching STATE or either
# slot's content, which is the operation a real
# LifecycleService.Upgrade/Rollback will eventually drive.
#
# Requires sgdisk (gdisk), ukify (systemd-ukify), mtools/dosfstools -
# none of it needs root: writes go straight to computed byte offsets in
# the image file, not through a mounted filesystem or loop device
# (unlike a real installer, which writes to an actual disk - this
# script only ever touches a plain file). See rootfs/state-image.sh's
# own note on why loop devices are avoided deliberately, not just
# incidentally, in this project's build tooling.
#
# The UKIs name their partitions by GPT label (PARTLABEL=BOOT-A-DATA...),
# so the disk boots whatever it attaches as: /dev/vda, /dev/sda,
# /dev/nvme0n1...
#
# Usage: image/disk/assemble.sh <out-file> <bzImage> <rootfs-dir> <state-image> [active-slot] [boot-filename]
# <rootfs-dir> must contain rootfs.squashfs and rootfs.verity (see
# rootfs/assemble.sh). <state-image> from rootfs/state-image.sh.
# [active-slot] is "A" or "B", defaulting to "A". [boot-filename] is
# passed straight through to activate-slot.sh's own (BOOTX64.EFI by
# default).

# Fixed, over-provisioned partition sizes, matching a real A/B system:
# the partition table is laid out once and doesn't grow with the image
# - rootfs.squashfs (~8MiB today) and rootfs.verity (~72KiB today) just
# need to fit inside them, with headroom for the rootfs to grow later
# without needing a new partition table. ESP_MB (64) comfortably fits
# one UKI (~4.5MiB today). STATE_MB (128, must match rootfs/
# state-image.sh's own size for <state-image> to actually fill it) is
# bigger than PKI/config alone would ever need: until this project has
# real OCI/HTTPS image distribution and a dedicated staging area,
# LifecycleService.Upgrade's release bundle (image/release/
# assemble.sh - squashfs+verity+two UKIs, together a few 10s of MiB)
# has nowhere else already-writable and already-reachable from inside
# a running node to land before installing - see hack/
# qemu-lifecycle-upgrade-test.sh for exactly why (janusctl and
# janusd don't share a filesystem across the QEMU host/guest
# boundary the way CLAUDE.md's own "-ca/-cert/-key ... handy when ctl
