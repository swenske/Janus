# Assembles the immutable rootfs: builds a squashfs image from rootfs/base
# + the given binaries/config, then computes its dm-verity hash tree.
# Requires mksquashfs (squashfs-tools) and veritysetup (cryptsetup-bin) on
# PATH - neither needs root privileges for this (only mounting/verifying
# a *live* dm-verity device does).
#
# Usage: rootfs/assemble.sh <out-dir> <init-bin> <janusd-bin> <haproxy-bin> <haproxy-cfg> <selinux-policy> <ca-bundle>
#
# Writes to <out-dir>:
#   rootfs.squashfs   - the read-only root filesystem image
#   rootfs.verity     - its dm-verity hash tree
#   rootfs.roothash   - the root hash (hex), the one thing that must be
#                        trusted out-of-band (Phase 3+: embedded in the
#                        Secure-Boot-signed kernel cmdline/UKI, not shipped
#                        as a separate file on a real node)

# Debian installs veritysetup (cryptsetup-bin) to /usr/sbin, which isn't
# guaranteed to be on PATH for a non-interactive/non-root shell even once
# the package is installed - confirmed on janus-runner01, where this
# script's own `mksquashfs` call (installed to /usr/bin, always on PATH)
# succeeded but `veritysetup` failed with "command not found" despite
# `apt-get install cryptsetup-bin` having just run cleanly in the same job.

# Phase 4 cont'd (SELinux): the only three files on this rootfs whose
# type actually needs to be more specific than selinux/policy.conf's own
# fs_use_xattr default (squashfs_t) - the three real executables, so
# rootfs/init's own domain transitions (init_t -> janusd_t ->
# haproxy_t) have something to key off. Labeled via mksquashfs's own
# pseudo-file `x` action (below), not a plain `setfattr` on the source
# tree before mksquashfs runs, which turned out not to work at all here:
# a real setfattr call on $WORKDIR (mktemp -d's default, tmpfs-backed
# under WSL2) reports success and even reads back correctly with a
# direct getfattr - but mksquashfs itself, run either as the build user
# or as root, never picks the xattr up into the image regardless (traced
# with an isolated single-file reproduction, `-xattrs-include` didn't
# help either - mksquashfs's own directory-tree xattr scan just doesn't
# see it). The pseudo-file mechanism sidesteps that scan entirely, the
# same reason /var/empty's own mode-0000 pseudo-entry below already
# exists instead of a real chmod'd directory in $WORKDIR: mksquashfs
# sets the attribute directly while writing the image, rather than
# reading it back off a real inode first.

# The chroot jail (see cmd/janusd's -haproxy-chroot-dir) is added as

# unreadable/unenterable directory can't be read back by mksquashfs
# itself when it isn't running as root (caught the same way as the
# root-mode issue above: it silently vanished from the built image,
# `mksquashfs` only warned "Could not open ... skipping").
