	// *os.File - and that goroutine's lifecycle is tied to calling
	// cmd.Wait(), which this package deliberately never does (see
	// runOnce): PID 1 reaps every child through a single shared wait4
	// loop instead, since running cmd.Wait() concurrently with a manual
	// wait4(-1, ...) loop would race both to reap the same pid. A
	// non-*os.File writer here would leak one goroutine per restart,

	// attempt (not reset by individual crashes, so a process crashing
	// repeatedly still gives up on schedule rather than getting an
	// ever-renewing budget) - before calling OnGiveUp instead of
	// spawning again and returning. This is the *one* exception to "no
	// give-up threshold, ever" this package otherwise holds to (see the
	// package doc comment): used only by rootfs/init's boot-commit
	// handling, to force a revert to the previous A/B slot when the
	// current one's janusd can't even stay running long enough to
	// run its own HAProxy-level health check (cmd/janusd/main.go,
	// internal/bootcommit.Confirm) rather than restarting a doomed
	// instance forever - a real, different action from "giving up" on
	// reaching the node at all, since the reverted slot is a
	// previously-known-good one. Zero (the default) preserves the
	// unconditional "restart forever" behavior every other caller
